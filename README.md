# Predicting Diabetes using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes occurrence using clinical biomarkers. Based on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, we analyzed various medical factors like Glucose levels, BMI, and Age to build a predictive model. The project also includes a formal research paper drafted in **LaTeX**.

## 📊 Key Research Findings
* [cite_start]**Accuracy:** Achieved a predictive accuracy of **73.38%** using the Random Forest Classifier[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Primary Biomarker:** Glucose (Plas) was identified as the most significant predictor with a correlation coefficient of **0.47**[cite: 15, 27, 290].
* [cite_start]**Dataset Balance:** The dataset contains 500 non-diabetic and 268 diabetic samples[cite: 229, 382, 390].
* [cite_start]**Methodology:** Employed Python for data analysis and **Overleaf (LaTeX)** for professional research documentation[cite: 11, 12, 225].

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python
* [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn [cite: 224, 225]
* **Documentation:** LaTeX (Overleaf)
* [cite_start]**Dataset Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository [cite: 9, 137, 212]
